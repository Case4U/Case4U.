                    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                        <p>My name is Fatima Hayde Molas Montiel, I was born in 2002 October 28th in Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay. My father, Pedro, is an agronomic engineer, and my mother, Domi, holds a degree in education sciences. I have a twin brother named Pedro, who is currently studying law at the university.
                            During my childhood and adolescence, I became accustomed to changing environments as I moved several times between cities, and therefore, schools. During my early years, until I was about 10 years old, I lived in the city of Villa Elisa. There, I attended preschool at the Cerritos Presbyterian School and completed my first year of elementary education at the "San Carlos" school. For the second and third grades, I returned to Cerritos Presbyterian School. In 2012, we moved to the city of Itá, where I completed the fourth and fifth grades at the "Maria Auxiliadora Pedagogical Institute." In 2014, we relocated to Asunción, where I have been residing ever since. I attended Sor Eusebia Palomino School from sixth to ninth grade. Later, with the aim of attending a school with better education and reputation, I transferred to the Paraguay Brazil Experimental School, where I completed my high school education in Computer Science and graduated in 2020.
                            I believe these changes helped shape me into someone who doesn't have many difficulties adapting to new environments and people. After finishing high school, it was challenging to decide which career to pursue at university. After much contemplation and even changing my mind, I decided to take the entrance exam at the Taiwan Paraguay Polytechnic University. By the time I made this decision, it was already January 2021, and the entrance exam was almost a month away. So, I decided to wait for the exam the following year and prepare thoroughly. In 2022, I ranked seventh in the Industrial Engineering program and am currently in my fifth semester in Taiwan, where I will be until my seventh semester.
                            I hope that my stay and study in Taiwan will help me develop more open-minded thinking in both professional and personal areas. I believe that being in Taiwan will help me grow in both aspects because, unlike in Paraguay, I see that the majority of professors and people have a broader view of the world and not just what surrounds them.

                        <h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
                        <p>In 2019, I completed an internship during high school at the General Direction of Public Accounting within the Ministry of Economy. During this internship, I was assigned to the IT Support Department where I played a key role in resolving minor malfunctions with employees' devices. Additionally, I gained experience in analyzing and reporting technical issues, contributing to the efficient functioning of the department. 
                            Also, from the end of 2022 to the beginning of 2023, I worked as an English teacher for children at the Paraguayan-Japanese Center. This experience significantly contributed to my personal and professional growth by cultivating a sense of responsibility, enhancing my ability to organize tasks effectively, and improving my interpersonal skills. Additionally, it provided me with valuable experience in reporting to my superiors, further honing my communication and accountability skills.

                        <p>
                            In my everyday life, I find happiness and fulfillment in various interests and activities. I adore spending time with animals, especially dogs and cats, as their company brings me immense joy and comfort. I also enjoy the simple pleasures like having a cup of coffee and treating myself to something sweet in the afternoon, which helps me relax and unwind. Staying active is important to me, whether it's hitting the gym or playing basketball with friends. Exploring different cuisines and trying out new restaurants is another passion of mine, as I love discovering tasty food spots. When I have downtime, I enjoy watching anime for its captivating stories and colorful animation. Additionally, music plays a big role in my life, providing me with comfort and inspiration through its melodies and rhythms. These interests not only make my days brighter but also shape my outlook on life.

                        <p>
                            In my professional journey, I aim to find a specialization within industrial engineering that ignites my passion and allows me to make a meaningful contribution to society. I envision a career where work is not just an obligation but a source of passion and fulfillment. Personally, I aspire to explore the world through travel and make a positive impact by helping animals in street situations. Ultimately, I hope to create a future where I can enjoy my work, travel, and contribute to causes I care about.
